       <p>Are you unfamiliar with what Deer data looks like and how it relates to a probability distance distribution? If not this section will allow you to create a distance distribution composed of up to two Gaussian distributions. This distribution will then be used to simulate a Deer decay.</p>

       <p>This is a more direct method of looking at the usefulness of fitting data with a convolutional neural network. Create a simulated distance distribution and see how well model 2B is able to reproduce the input distance distribution. Due to the size of the model and loading times into the browser this examination is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, 'XX'. It is available at the <a href="https://github.com/RS-ND/Capstone-Project.git">repository</a>.</p>
